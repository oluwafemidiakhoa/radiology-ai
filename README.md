ü©ª Radiology AI - AI-Powered Medical Imaging Analysis
üöÄ Overview
Radiology AI is an advanced, multi-specialty medical imaging platform designed to address use cases in radiology, cardiology, and oncology. It leverages GPT-4 Vision (GPT-4V) along with cutting-edge deep learning models to analyze X-ray, CT, MRI, and DICOM images. The platform generates structured diagnostic reports, provides differential diagnoses, and integrates real-time clinical guidelines (e.g., ACR, NCCN, ESC).

Disclaimer: While our pipeline is technologically advanced, all outputs must be verified by a board-certified specialist. Regulatory approval and clinical validation are essential before deploying in a clinical setting.

‚ú® Key Features
AI-Powered Image Analysis: Supports X-ray, CT, MRI, and DICOM imaging for radiology, cardiology, and oncology.
Advanced LADDER-Based Ensemble: Combines ResNet18 and MobileNetV2 models with Monte Carlo dropout to produce robust diagnostic predictions and refine outcomes through reinforcement learning.

Classification Pipelines:
Transformer-Based Classification (Optional): Uses a Hugging Face Vision Transformer (ViT) model for supplementary image classification.
open_clip-Based Classification: Leverages the BiomedCLIP-Finetuned model from Hugging Face, identified as:
hf-hub:mgbam/OpenCLIP-BiomedCLIP-Finetuned

This model generates image embeddings for zero-shot classification and serves as a proxy for diagnostic confidence.
GPT-4V Multimodal Reasoning: Integrates image and text analysis to generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
Structured Reports with Differentials & Guidelines: Automatically produces clinically relevant reports by integrating consolidated differential diagnoses and evidence-based guidelines.
Scalable Storage: Uses MongoDB (Atlas/Render) for storing medical images, metadata, and logs.
Robust Hosting: Deployed on Render.com with Cloudflare CDN ensuring high availability, security, and performance.
PubMed Integration: Fetches relevant, up-to-date medical research to support diagnostic insights.

Example: Analyze Medical Image
python
Copy
import requests

url = "https://your-api-url.onrender.com/analyze-image"
files = {'file': open('chest_xray.png', 'rb')}
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer your_openai_api_key"}
params = {
    "specialty": "radiology",  # or 'cardiology', 'oncology'
    "age": 45,
    "sex": "M"
}
response = requests.post(url, files=files, headers=headers, params=params)

üìà Model Architecture & Components
Advanced LADDER-Based Diagnosis
LADDER Ensemble: Utilizes ResNet18 and MobileNetV2 models with Monte Carlo dropout to provide robust image diagnoses.
Reinforcement Learning: Iteratively refines predictions by generating image variants (e.g., ROI extraction, Gaussian blur, multi-scale) to enhance diagnostic confidence.
Specialty-Specific Output: Integrates consolidated differentials and evidence-based guidelines tailored for radiology, cardiology, and oncology.
Classification Pipelines
Transformer-Based Classification (Optional):
Uses a Hugging Face Vision Transformer (ViT) model to provide supplementary image classification results.
open_clip-Based Classification:
Leverages the BiomedCLIP-Finetuned model from Hugging Face, identified as:
