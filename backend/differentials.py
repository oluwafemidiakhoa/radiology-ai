"""
Consolidated Differential Diagnosis Dictionary for Medical Imaging (Enterprise Version)

This module merges advanced differential diagnosis dictionaries from Radiology, Oncology,
and Cardiology, as well as evidence-based guidelines, into a cohesive resource.
It is specifically designed to support large-scale clinical analytics and AI-driven
diagnostics across the three primary specialties:
  - Radiology
  - Cardiology
  - Oncology

Usage:
- The main AI analysis pipeline imports and references `medical_differentials`
  to incorporate domain-specific differentials and guidelines.
- Each specialtyâ€™s dictionary can be extended or replaced with new or updated
  content as medical knowledge evolves.
